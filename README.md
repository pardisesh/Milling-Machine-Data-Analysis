# MillingMachineDataAnalysis
In this project a milling machine is anallyze. The machine has three bearings which breaks down during the work.
When one of the bearings is damaged, the milling machine stops working and a new bearing must be installed. 
The period of replacing the bearings is different. One suggestion is that whenever one bearing fails, all three should be replaced. 
In this project, I evaluated this proposal.
